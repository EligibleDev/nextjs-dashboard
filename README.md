# Financial Dashboard Project

## Overview

This project is a simplified version of a financial dashboard built using Next.js. The application includes key features such as a public home page, a login page, protected dashboard pages, and the ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices. Additionally, the project incorporates a database that will be set up in a later chapter of the course.

By completing this course, you will acquire essential skills for building full-stack Next.js applications. The topics covered include styling, optimizations for images, links, and fonts, routing with nested layouts and pages, data fetching with best practices for fetching and streaming, search and pagination using URL Search Params, mutating data with React Server Actions, error handling for general and 404 not found errors, form validation and accessibility with server-side validation, authentication using NextAuth.js and Middleware, and metadata for social sharing.
